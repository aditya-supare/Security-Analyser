# Security Analyzer for Websites

This project is a Streamlit app that analyzes website content for potential security vulnerabilities. It scrapes or crawls the website using the Firecrawl API, checks for insecure elements, and provides security improvement suggestions using OpenAI's GPT model.

## Features

- **Scrape or Crawl Content**: Retrieve website content through scraping or crawling with the Firecrawl API.
- **Security Analysis**: Detect common security issues, such as HTTP URLs or exposed sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
- **Security Improvement Suggestions**: Get security enhancement recommendations generated by OpenAI's GPT model.
- **Downloadable Report**: Download the generated security improvement suggestions as a text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Firecrawl API key
- An OpenAI API key
